If you have issues with wallet syncing additional data 
download windowsWaletSyncFix.bat
and runn as admin on your windows where the wallet is (keep walet open)

What the script dose?
1. disables local ethernet adapter, 
2. wait for 30 seconds and 
3. then enable id back
Thats it!

This is NOT gonna work if you are on WiFi


If you get any value from this you can 
send me some TELOS Donation
