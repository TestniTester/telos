Transcendence CORE unofficial!


If you have issues with wallet syncing additional data 

<b>Wallet sync issues<b>
download windowsWaletSyncFix.bat
and runn as admin on your windows where the wallet is (keep walet open)

What the script dose?
1. disables local ethernet adapter, 
2. wait for 30 seconds and 
3. then enable id back
Thats it!

This is NOT gonna work if you are on WiFi


If you have brand new install of wallet you can download last bootstrap file.

Open file explorer and type in %appdata%/Transcendence
1. close the wallet
2. create a copy of wallet.dat (if you lose this, you lose your TELOS!)
3. extract data from zip into opened folder
4. open wallet.... (wallet should sync really fast)




If you get any value from this you can 
send me some TELOS Donation
